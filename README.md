Notes to operators

To initialize you might need to run ``git submodule update --init --recursive``. See crontab for periodically run commands &mdash; each line corresponds to a target site.

All accounts operated under http://tools.wmflabs.org/archiving/ should be attached to tools.archiving@tools.wmflabs.org.
